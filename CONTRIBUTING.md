Thank you for taking the time to contribute!

## Code of Conduct

The fundamental rules are:

* **DON'T be a Gavin Belson.**  You probably are smarter and more successful than everone else, but be humble and helpful.
* **DON'T be a Jian Yang.**  Stealing other people's IP is lower than a snake's belly.
* You *CAN* be a Bertram Gilfoyle, that's fundamentally just being an engineer.
* You *CAN* be a Big Head, but only if you invite me to all your house parties.
* You *CAN* be an Erlich Bachman because the world needs dreamers.
* You *CAN* be a Richard Hendricks, because ethical software is a good thing.
* You *CAN* be a Dinesh Chugtai because every team needs someone to good-heartedly pick on.

# How Can I Contribute?

## For Everyone

### Reporting Issues

> The only dumb issue is the unreported issue.

The purpose of an issue (or bug, condition, corrective action, FRACA) tracking system is to document **conditions adverse to quality (CAQ)** and their fixes.  A mispelled word in documentation or a docstring is a condition adverse to quality so *submit an issue*.

> **Note:** If you find a **Closed** issue that seems like it is the same thing that you're experiencing, open a new issue and include a link to the original issue in the body of your new one.

#### Before Submitting an Issue Report

**Perform a search** to see if the problem has already been reported.  If it has **and the issue is still open**, add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one.

### Pull Requests

When opening a pull request:

* Do not include issue numbers in the PR title.
* Include screenshots in your pull request whenever possible.
* Document new engineering specification(s).
* Document new code.
* End all files with a newline.
* Avoid platform-dependent code.
